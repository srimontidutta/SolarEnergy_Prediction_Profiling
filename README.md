# Performance & Resource Consumption Evaluation of Different Models for Prediction of Solar Radiation

## Dataset
Open-source HI-SEAS weather station data provided by NASA

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploring the data in terms of information, type, description, size, and missing or null values which might be present

## Data Preprocessing
Correction of data type representation, checking data distribution, correlation analysis and heatmap generation

## Modeling
Experimentation with 4 models- Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Support Vector Regression to find the best fit

## Profiling
Code profiling for performance evaluation has been done with cProfile and profiling visualization has been done using SnakeViz
